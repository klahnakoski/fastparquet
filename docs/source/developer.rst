Running tests
-------------

Aside from the requirements for using this package, the following additional
packages should be present:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pytest

Some tests also require:

- s3fs
- moto
- pyspark

Build ``speedups.pyx``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The speedups module was written in cython and must be compiled:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Install ``python-snappy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `python-snappy` is required for tests, but it requires a compiler,
which can be difficult to get running on Windows. Instead, `download an
unofficial pre-compiled version <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-snappy>`_
and install.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install python_snappy-0.5.1-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl

Building Docs
-------------

The *docs/* directory contains source code for the documentation. You will
need sphinx and numpydoc to successfully build. sphinx allows output in
many formats, including html:

.. code-block:: bash

    # in directory docs/
    make html

This will produce a ``build/html/`` subdirectory, where the entry point is
``index.html``.
